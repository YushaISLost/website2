					<h3>The Arduino Project</h3> <h3>Level: Beginner-Friendly</h3>
					<p> I completed this project using Arduino LED lights and learned how to control LED lights with an Arduino board and generate various lighting patterns through programming. I also gained knowledge of serial communication protocols, C++, and Python.
To complete the project, I connected the LED lights to the Arduino board and wrote code to generate different lighting patterns. I also connected the Arduino board to a Raspberry Pi and developed a custom interface to control the lights.
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with programming, hardware, and project development. Additionally, I gained an understanding of LED lights and how to control them using an Arduino board.</p>

					<h3>The RFID Project </h3> <h3>Level: Advance</h3>
					<p>I am currently working on a project on creating a quick and easy way of sharing your resume with potential employers or as networking contacts. Simply by only using a tap card similar to those used in payment kiosks. 
                       Programming languages used may be C++, Java, or Python, which will be used for programming the RFID and NFC devices. </p>
